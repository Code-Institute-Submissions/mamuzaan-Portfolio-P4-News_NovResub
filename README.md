I have designed both desktop and mobile wireframes in the same time but I have taken mobile first approach. This app look good and work well on both desktop and mobile device.

## Existing Features

### Navbar and Footer

Navbar and Footer hase been copied from a part of Bootstrap components and adjusted to the needs of the project.

I have used a beautiful navbar with icons found in bootstrap examples in headers. The design was quite unique and bootstrap classes have hindered the design.
